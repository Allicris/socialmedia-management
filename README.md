# Refactoring Code

## Description
This is a social media management website that has helpful information and resources you could use to elevate your social media platform. We were given a starter code and had to refactor the code without altering the format or content on the website.

## Usage 
One can easily be directed to a desired section of the website by clicking one of the options on the navigation bar. The rest of the content is nicely divided and easy to read. 

## Website 
You can access the website with the URL: https://allicris.github.io/socialmedia-management/#online-reputation-management
The website should look like the image below.
